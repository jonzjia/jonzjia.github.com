title: vim ftp & keyboard remapping

----------------
After reading [this article][1] on how to level up as a programmer, I decided
to learn vim.

I have to say, after the initial pain of learning how to do anything, vim is
really freaking cool. I don't know if it's enough to sway me over from Sublime
Text 2, but it's really cool.

For example, I just found out that you can ftp straight into a server and use
vim to navigate and edit your website with your existing vim setup. The command
is stupid simple in Terminal:

    vim ftp://username@domain/

Don't forget the ending slash! I forgot it and kept getting directed to strange
places.

To make it a little easier on my hands while using vim, I remapped the
caps-lock key on my keyboard to the 'esc' key with [KeyRemap4MacBook][2]. Works
like a charm.

Finally, learning through the vim shortcuts, suddenly a lot of the keyboard
shortcuts in gmail and google reader make a lot more sense (ie, 'j' to move
down mail, 'k' to move up mail, and '/' to use the search bar).

Ok, that's it for now. But I'll keep posting more cool things as I find them in
vim. I'm still a noobie, but hopefully someone will find this useful.
