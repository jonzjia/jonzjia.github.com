title: I hate wearing a suit

It was hot today, especially in the morning. I work in an office in East
Midtown.

As far as I can tell, Midtown East is mostly full of people working in the
financial services industry.

I got into the elevator with a middle-aged man, fully-suited and sweating from
his balding head.

"It's hot out huh"

"Yeah, I feel it too and I'm not wearing a suit. I can't imagine how you must
feel."

He paused. The door to my floor opened.

"I hate wearing a suit."

Then he smiled and waved as I stepped out.

"Have a good day!"

I waved back.

"You too."
